## Goal

Confirm the user is told what is being collected, why, for how long, and that participation is voluntary.

## Evidence to look for

1. Consent text appears before sensitive questions.
2. Consent includes purpose, retention, and who can access.
3. Consent includes a stop or exit option.

## Pass criteria

## Fail examples
