# Auditability check

## Goal

Make interaction outcomes inspectable by a reviewer.

## Evidence to look for

1. Key events are logged: consent shown, consent accepted, sensitive question asked, output delivered.
2. Key decisions have reasons.
3. A reviewer can reconstruct the flow without raw sensitive content.

## Pass criteria

Logs are sufficient to explain what happened and why.
